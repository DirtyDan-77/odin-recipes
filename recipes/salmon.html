    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the salmon:</h4>
    <ul>
        2–3 salmon fillets (skin on or off)
        3 tbsp butter
        2 cloves garlic, minced
        1 tsp lemon zest
        1 tbsp lemon juice
        1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (or 1 tsp dried)
        1 tsp chopped thyme (or ½ tsp dried)
        Salt & pepper to taste
    </ul>
    <h4>For the vegetables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 zucchini, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Prep the veggies: Toss the chopped veggies in olive oil, salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of dried oregano. Spread them out on one side of a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Make garlic herb butter: In a small bowl, combine butter, minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Prep the salmon: Pat the fillets dry. Place them on the other side of the baking sheet. Spread the garlic herb butter evenly on top.</li>
        <li>Roast everything for about 15–18 minutes, until the salmon is flaky and the veggies are tender. If you want a slightly crisp top, broil the salmon for an extra 2 minutes at the end.</li>
        <li>Serve with lemon wedges, maybe a side of crusty bread or a simple salad.</li>
    </ol>
